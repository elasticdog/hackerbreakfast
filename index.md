### Welcome

Hacker Breakfast is a weekly meeting of local people interested in all things technology. No matter the flavor of your nerdery, we'd love to meet you and see what you're in to. Bring a laptop and come work on your projects in the company of other fantastic hackers. Share ideas, get advice, eat baked goods, and drink coffee!

### Schedule

There is no official agenda and people come and go as they please, but most of us stick around for a couple of hours. Swing by any time and say hello!
